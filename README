 Design Memo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Widget system bases on tree fundations:
  1. Family tree builds the event path
    Pressing keys, pop-up widgets and all the other events are passed through
    the family tree. The class Application emits events to all top-level
    Object objects. Every Object object passes the event to its children.

  2. Layout tree bookkeeps WINDOW strcutres
    When you create a Layout object, the system creates a WINDOW for you.
